Consumer Web UI Applications Recruitment Test
===========================================

Thank you for taking the time to do our technical test.

1) Create an HTML file that has a login form with a username and password. Use semantic, accessible and valid mark-up.

2) Style the form so that labels are to the left of the fields and inputs are to the right of the fields.

3) Write script that defines a FormValidator constructor with methods on the prototype to validate and display error messages for invalid username/password. It only has to check whether the fields are blank or not.

4) Use external scripts and css files.

5) Don't pollute the global object (Only one should be required for the namespace you choose)

6) Test drive the code via unit tests (Jasmine or an equivalent)

7) Should work in IE7+ as well as more modern browsers.
