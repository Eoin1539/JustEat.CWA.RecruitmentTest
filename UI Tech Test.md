UI Tech Test
============

### Task requirements

Please:
* Create an HTML file that has a login form with a username and password. Use semantic, accessible and valid mark-up.
* Style the form so that labels are to the left of the fields and inputs are to the right of the fields.
* Write script that defines a FormValidator constructor with methods on the prototype to validate and display error messages for invalid username/password. It only has to check whether the fields are blank or not.
* Use external scripts and css files.
* Don't pollute the global object (Only one should be required for the namespace you choose)
* Test drive the code via unit tests (Jasmine or an equivalent)
* Should work in IE7+ as well as more modern browsers.
